# G-Rewind

### G-Code Reversal and Optimization Tool

**G-Rewind** is a specialized tool designed to reverse G-code files, reorganize feed rates, and manage Z parameters to simulate reverse 3D printing. It intelligently removes redundant commands, optimizes motion paths, and ensures the integrity of reversed operations. This tool is ideal for reverse motion simulations, G-code optimization, and analyzing 3D printing paths.

## Features

- **G-Code Reversal:** Reverses the order of G-code instructions to simulate reverse motion.
- **Feed Rate Optimization:** Analyzes and reorganizes feed rates for optimal movement.
- **Z Parameter Management:** Adjusts Z coordinates to ensure smooth, consistent layer transitions.
- **Redundant Command Removal:** Cleans up redundant feed rate (`F`) and Z (`Z`) commands.
- **Initialization Block Management:** Handles and removes initialization blocks from G-code generated by slicers like Cura.
- **Safe Z Injection:** Injects a safe Z movement at the beginning of the reversed G-code to avoid collisions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or higher
- Basic knowledge of G-code

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/G-Rewind.git
cd G-Rewind
```

### Building the Project

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Restore the NuGet packages if needed.
3. Build the solution to generate the executable.

### Running the Tool

Once built, the tool can be executed from the command line or by running the generated executable directly.

## Usage

1. Place your input G-code files in the `g-codes/input` directory.
2. Configure the `config.json` file in the `g-codes/config` directory to match your machine's settings.
3. Run the tool. The processed G-code will be saved in the `g-codes/output` directory.

## G-Code Overview

G-code is the language used to instruct 3D printers and CNC machines. Each line of G-code consists of commands that move the machine's axes, control feed rates, and manage other functions. Below is a brief explanation of common G-code commands:

### Common G-Code Commands

- **G0/G1:** Linear move. G0 is a rapid move, and G1 is a controlled move at a specified feed rate.
- **F:** Feed rate. Specifies the speed at which the print head moves.
- **X, Y, Z:** Coordinates. Defines the position of the print head in the 3D space.
- **M104/M109:** Set extruder temperature.
- **M140/M190:** Set bed temperature.
- **M82/M83:** Set extrusion mode to absolute (M82) or relative (M83).
- **G28:** Home all axes.

### Example G-Code Snippet

```gcode
G1 F1500 X0.00 Y-550 Z1.25  ; Move to coordinates with feed rate of 1500
G0 F4000 X0.00 Y0.00 Z1.25  ; Rapid move to new coordinates
G1 X476.314 Y275 Z1.25      ; Controlled move to new coordinates
G1 X0.00 Y0.00              ; Move back to start point
```

### Reversed G-Code Example

After processing with G-Rewind, the G-code might look like this:

```gcode
G1 X0.00 Y0.00 Z1.25        ; Move back to start point
G0 F4000 X0.00 Y0.00 Z1.25  ; Rapid move to previous coordinates
G1 F1500 X476.314 Y275 Z1.25; Controlled move to previous position
G1 X0.00 Y-550 Z1.25        ; Reverse move to the starting coordinates
```
