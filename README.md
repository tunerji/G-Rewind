# G-Rewind
G-Code Reversal and Optimization Tool This tool reverses G-code files, reorganizing feed rates and Z parameters to simulate reverse 3D printing. It removes redundant commands, optimizes movements, and ensures the integrity of reversed operations. Ideal for reverse motion simulations and G-code optimization.
